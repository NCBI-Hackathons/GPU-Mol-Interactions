# TurboReceptors

## Awesome Logo

## Intro statement

### We optimized molecular interaction simulation code to run on a GPU instead of a CPU!

#### Existing code is too slow. Thus we are optimizing the current matlab code, then converting it to C, then writing some parts in CUDA C to run on a GPU.

#### Speeding up simulations will give us more versatility to run the program under many conditions to understand better how receptors function in membrane space.
